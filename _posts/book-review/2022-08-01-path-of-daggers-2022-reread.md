##### Summary
In an interesting twist we actually go back in time and pick up about a day behind where book 7 ended. Elayne and Nynave along with the Aes Sedai in Ebu Dar with the Kin and the Athan Merie windfinders use the bowl of the winds to fix the weather. The Seanchan attack after they finish and they all travel to Andor.

Perrin is getting settled in Ghealdan and the Queen of Ghealdan Allinadre swears fealty to him. They get ready to move on the Prophet.

Rand is cleaning up Illian and the army that Sammeal left behind. He is now preparing to attack the Seanchan which entreached along the mountain coast between Ebu Dar and Illian.

Egwene and Salidar sisters are stopped by an army at the border of Andor. She uses this to maneuver a halt to the march and prepares to spring the trap of traveling straight to tar valon for the siege.

Rand sets off on a campaign through Altara to push back the Seanchan advance into the mountains along the coast. He succeeds in pushing back the Seanchan army.

Elayne reaches Camelyn. Rand is attacked in Cairhien and sets to leave. Perrin meets the Prophet. Faile and company are captured by the Shadio. Egwene travels her army and saldiar sisters to siege tar valon.

##### My Thoughts
It feels as though the end of book 7 was cut off and stuck at the start of book 8. Reading through this book I kept thinking this book is great why have I not liked this book for so many years. All the sequences are well done, Elayne and Nyneave healing the weather. Perrin reaching Ghealdan. Rand fighting in Altara. Egwene and the Tower. It's all great. and then we reach the last 50 pages.

It's the ending that really throws the book. All the cliff hanger endings, that take like three or four more books to resolve.

Perrin is off on camping trip two to find Faile. Egwene reached Tar Valon. Elayne is fighting for the throne. All of these story arcs take a long time to resolve and at times just seem unnecessary. So book 8 gets the blame for all these starting out and no real resolution.
