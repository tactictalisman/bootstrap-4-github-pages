##### My Thoughts
Leviathan Wakes is the first book in the expanse series. Jim Holden is working an ice hauler out on the rings of Saturn when a distress call turns out to be a trap. Him and his ragtag team are left trying to put the pieces back together and figure out what just happened.

John Miller is a detective on Ceres Station when he gets a missing person case that keeps hitting walls. He starts digging a little deeper only to find more questions than answers.

I really didn't like the first chapter of this book. The rest of the book, the story and the characters were well written, and very well done. I look forward to reading the whole series. But that first chapter was the most tacked on, insulting to my intelligence, type of thing I have read in a long time. I think it was poor writing and poor portrayal of the characters.

In the first chapter the characters bantering with profanity and gross sexual appetites had no point. Rushing through introductions with all this profanity and sexuality felt like the authors were simply trying to prove that hey this is going to be edgy. It was unneeded and felt strapped on, the book literally works fine if not better flowing if you just skip the first chapter.
