##### My Thoughts
The book started out slow and had some weird pacing. The inclusion of how old the character was to describe the next sequence was what made the next section seem awkwardly placed in some instances. Aside from some weird organization and outlining the story as a whole was exciting and well done.

I have a hard time being critical of young adult fiction. I always feel that the writing style is catering to a younger reader and that the age range of those potential readers can be all over the place so allowances for writing and the story have to made. Now all that being said the foreshadowing in this book is well written its not over the top, hit you over the face sort of thing. It works with the story as a whole and as you can tell it has won its share of awards.

The House of the Scorpion I think has found that happy medium of being compiling and interesting while at the same time catering to the young adult.

The greatest quality a book can have is leaving me wanting more and I definitely want more. I was unaware of the sequel when I first read it and seeing there is a sequel I am excited to check it out.
