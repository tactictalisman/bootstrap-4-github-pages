- **Pages**: 464
- **Series**: [Dune](#)

##### My Thoughts
I find that Chapterhouse is probably my favorite of the final three volumes Herbert wrote. In his final volume (we are excluding the later sequels written by his son for now), the complexities of all the other works reach a crescendo, the depth is intriguing and the climax is perfectly brought together. While Herbert never wrote a sequel I think the ending is satisfying and leaves your imagination with a thought provoking “what now?”

All that being said Herbert’s son did put together a  two volume sequel Hunters of Dune and Sandworms of Dune. While I don’t plan to read those immediately as my list of to reads has exploded in the last six months I will put them on there and see if I can find some time for these last two books.

One interesting comparison I keep going back to that isn’t at all related to Dune or Frank Herbert is how similar Robert Jordan’s Aes Sedai in the Wheel of Time seem in structure to the Bene Gessrit. Just an afterthought Jordan must have at least read these dune books in passing. Who knows, they seem very similar to me in ways.

#####  What is the series of Dune really about?
The series of Dune at its core is about a group of women called the Bene Gessrit who are trying to control the human race. Always through subtle nudges and pushes towards their supposed agenda of a free thinking mankind.

The first three books are about how they messed up by having a rogue member who had a son who became a kwaitsh hadrach. An omniscient being who could see all outcomes to all decisions. He also had a son who became a kwaitch hadrach and he spent the next 3500 years ensuring that the human race would never be destroyed.

The last three books are about the Bene Gesserit receiving control again to perpetuate the race of mankind toward a free government state. Though they are often busy worrying about their own survival.
