##### My Thoughts

I really enjoyed [Steelheart](https://tactictalisman.github.io/2014/01/15/steelheart.html) and [Firefight](https://tactictalisman.github.io/2020/06/07/firefight.html) so I had high hopes that this last book would be quiet, amazing.

Calamity wrapped up the story well enough. All the story arcs got some treatment and felt satisfying. The action for the ending could have been better. It just didn't feel quite as epic as it could have, no pun intended.

I felt like all the characters got some page time. The pacing was good. We learn more about Epics. The story expands and contracts in all the right ways. The ending just left me a little underwhelmed. Kind of like this review.

Anyway take it for what it's worth the first two books had me invested in the world and these characters so maybe it's a fitting conclusion that the last book doesn't overwhelm the stories from the first.

The whole series is a quick read and entertaining. I would recommend them if you have some time.
