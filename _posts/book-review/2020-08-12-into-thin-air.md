---

My palms are still sweaty from this one.

- **Title**: Into Thin Air
- **Author**: Jon Krakauer
- **Published**: 1997
- **Genre**: Non-Fiction
- **Pages**: 416
- **Film**: Everest

##### My Thoughts
A first hand account of the tragic and controversial 1996 mount Everest expedition disaster.

Into Thin Air is a sad story about people pushing themselves to their limits doing something they love.

I understand their is several other books with varying accounts of the events that unfolded on Everest that spring. They may be of particular interest for those wishing to dig deeper into the event.
