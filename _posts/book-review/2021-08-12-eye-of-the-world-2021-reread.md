##### My Thoughts
It has been a few years since I read Jordanâ€™s Eye of the World. I think this is maybe the 5th or 6th time I have lost count. This read through I was paying close attention to all the foreshadowing going on. Events and cultures that are books away are foreshadowed constantly. Jordan must have been pre writing this thing for years beforehand.

The backstory that drips out for example with the History of Manetheren and the Trolloc Wars and then the History of Malkier. I mean these were short two or three page stories but they add so much depth to the places and cultures and characters of course. Maybe I just really enjoy those particular points.

This first book is very well written with the highs and lows of the conflicts well laid out. I have already dived into the next book. 

The History of Manetheren in first hundred pages
p.436 - 437 Artur Hawkwing History
P.708 - 711 The Fall of Malkier
