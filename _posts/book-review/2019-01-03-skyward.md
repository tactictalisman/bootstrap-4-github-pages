##### My Thoughts
The rough spot here, and it might just be the young adult fiction, is the editing feels awkward at times. I don’t know if it's the pacing or what. If you add all the things together here the pacing, the descriptions, the plot it just doesn’t quite jel together if you get my meaning. It feels like there is a really good final draft out there that Sanderson’s team just didn’t have time to put together.

The story holds up. I really like the setting of a down and out human civilization scraping to get by. A lot of unknowns that we don’t get answers so we are learning with the characters is as always well done.

It just feels like Brandon has a really good template for making stories. He works hard and can flesh out the template really quick and get a book to market. Some of the art of it all just feels left on the table. Like Leonardo da Vinci said. Art is never finished, only abandoned. Well in this case it was abandoned a little too soon.
