##### My Thoughts
Trevize’s is questioning his decision from the last book, Foundation’s Edge. Seeking answers he sets out on a quest to find earth. He is thinking that on earth he might find an answer as to why he chose the way he did and if that is the right choice.

For me I did not enjoy Foundation and Earth as much as Foundation’s Edge. The story holds its own and takes a very Odyssey style journey which was exciting and very well told. The ending ties in a lot of story from the Robot series which as of this read through I have not read. If you had read the Robot series and then read this I am sure it would mean more.

All that being said I think Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth is a solid story arc that works well and is very well told. I think I just didn’t care much for the story itself.

So I am now at a loss. I think I am going to go back and read the Foundation Prequels. There is another sequel to Foundation and Earth that was ghost written that came out in 1999 I might look into that.
