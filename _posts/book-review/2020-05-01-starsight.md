##### My Thoughts
I made a big assumption about Starsight I had framed in mind that this book would continue along the same vein as the first. A scrappy survival story where man kind is on the brink of extinction fighting a war against all odds.

So it's only fitting that the story turned out to be about challenge expectations and assumptions. After I got over what I wanted this story to be about and simply read the story my read went much smoother.

Now that being said I still have a lot of criticism for Starsight. The whole thing felt rushed. The plot arcs didn't quiet feel right. The foreshadowing, I guess you call it or on the nose dialogue was insulting. Now I get it's a young adult fiction but even still it was blatantly bad.

While I enjoyed the first entry in the series Starsight was not as good as the first and nether of the books is as well written as The Reckoners series.
