Spoiler Warning

##### Summary
After the cliffhanger ending of the last one. Glad I didn’t have to wait for the next volume. Sorry everyone who did. Darrow and crew are licking their wounds and looking for an edge. Running missions with the Sons of Ares as they try to build an advantage. Then Darrow takes over and pushes their vision much further than I thought they would get. A few space battles and crash landings later and we are ready for the plot twisting to start.

##### My Thoughts
A lot of gorgeous scenes I think volumes could have been written from the first part of this book. Lets see very much a Star Wars, Ender’s Game esque feel on this one. I would say Star Wars is our closest comparison. Although some cool references as always I had to think for a minute on the Princess of Mars reference but I finally remembered it.

Again the plot twists are everywhere. We finally cut out almost any intermediate text and just jump from twist to action to twist to action. After three books I am starting to get whiplash. I think the first book the Young Adult reader shows through quite a bit in this volume. 

Also knowing that there are three more books after this one I could see threads not wrapping up. Which kind of frustrated me as I was hoping for a solid three volume series with a conclusion. I guess the publishing company ordered three more books so what can you say.

A solid ending that I think ties things up quite nicely. You can read the first three volumes of this series and be confident in a finished product. I am glad it didn’t end in a cliffhanger. The ending wraps up quickly. The twists and turns are there and it's all very satisfying. I still think I enjoyed the second book the most. The third book felt like three different books coupled together.
