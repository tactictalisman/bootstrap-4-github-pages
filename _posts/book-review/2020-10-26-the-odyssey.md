Title: The Odyssey by Homer translated by W.H. D. Rouse
---

I have to admit I almost got lost reading this epic.

- **Title**: The Odyssey
- **Author**: Homer translated by W.H. D. Rouse
- **Published**: 1937
- **Genre**: Classic Epic
- **Pages**: 303 Paperback

##### My Thoughts
My read through of The Odyssey was rough. I had a really hard time getting through this book. Now that it has been a couple days the nostalgia is a good feeling and I am glad I read it.

If you are going to read make sure you understand the structure of the story at least the unabridged version is very jarring. The first 50 or 60 pages we spend with Odysseus' son while he laments the loss of his father and goes looking for him. Then we pick up with Odysseus in the middle of his story and he retells where he has been. Then the story shifts to his return home.

If you are at all interested in greek mythology and you havenâ€™t read this for some reason, its a worth a read. If you have no interest in this time period or the history of the epic or anything even related to it, you should probably take a pass on this one.

Also note The Iliad comes before The Odyssey so keep that in mind.

##### Summary
In short our good friend Odysseus has lost his way home from his ten year war in Troy. The Odyssey follows the struggles of him and his family as he makes his long journey home.
