##### My Thoughts
As book two is a Rand and Nynaeve’s book. Book three is mainly Perrin, Mat, and Egwene's perspectives. When I first read the book three years ago, I really didn’t like book three. I wanted more Rand. Reading through this last time I came to really appreciate book three. There is a lot of rich detail as the different characters are passing through lots of different places and meeting lots of characters.

Both Mat and Perrin really come to shine in this book. Personally I really look forward to their chapters from this point on especially Mats chapters. Mat’s scene dueling the half brothers from Andor is one of my favorite scenes from the entire series.

Also the other great POV is the chapter with Moriane and she and Lan have a moment. Then the following chapter is from Nynave point of view and really calls back to a lot of what Moriane was talking about in a couple of really amazing chapters.
