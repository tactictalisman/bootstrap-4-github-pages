##### My Thoughts

Lord of Chaos is one of my top three best books in the series. The play off of the black and white tower. The play off the salidar sisters and the tower sisters. Rand, Min, the Aiel, and Perrin, I mean I can’t list it all. Such a good book.

The book all comes together in one of my favorite conclusions at Dumai’s Well. I mean from this point on it's a defining point of a character if they were at Dumai’s Well.

In retrospect, having read this originally twenty years ago I thought Dumai’s Well was a lot longer sequence than it was. This book has a lot of Rand leading up to the epic conclusion. The Egwene sequences were masterfully done. I mean every threat in this book is woven with such great care. You can taste the conflict. It's so thick in the air.
