I have seen Steelheart bleed.

- **Title**: Steelheart
- **Author**: Brandon Sanderson
- **Published**: September 2013
- **Genre**: Young adult, fantasy
- **Pages**: 386
- **Series**: Book 1 in The Reckoners

##### My Thoughts
The backdrop of Steelheart is that normal people have gained superpowers but when they use them they become inherently evil. The story follows a young boy as he joins up with the resistance to stop the people with superpowers from suppressing humanity.

My wife has been reading through the young adult novels at the library. She saw this one by Brandon Sanderson and picked it up. She finished and suggested I read it. Wow this book was amazing. The quote on the back says Sanderson can write even good young adult fiction he is a very good writer. He delivers on this one for sure. The story is very compelling.

##### June 2020 Reread.

This was a good reread. Having read it once going back and seeing all the subtle clues was nice.

Steelheart is a good book I don't know how else to say it. The first time I read it I had a problem with the young adult angle of things but I think that was because I was reading through something like the dune series or some other really heavy science fiction. So I didn't appreciate it the simple and quick read that steelheart was.

Having read the second one and being on more of a young adult fiction kick it was a much more enjoyable read.
