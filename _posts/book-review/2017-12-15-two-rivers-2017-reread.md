##### My Thoughts
Reading through the Two Towers I came to understand why Lord of the Rings is a classic. I mean I always knew it was actually reading through it again makes me appreciate it that much more.

Without a doubt my favorite part is when Farmir is describing the history of Gondor and the men of the West.
Yet even so it was Gondor that brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed. â€˜Death was ever present, because the Numenoreans still, as they had in their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living, and counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in secret chambers  withered men compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the stars. And the last king of the line of Anarion had no heir. - The Two Towers p. 662 The lord of the rings

A real interesting section as comments about the history of his people as he struggles to make a decision about the hobbits and the ring.

Again as the Fellowship its the deep history that blends with the tale that takes my imagination on a hundred more journeys through this beautiful piece of work.

I know it sounds flowery but the book just begs to be described as such. If you haven't read the LOTR take sometime to que it up on your reading list for me it ha been to long.

A couple of other quotes that I liked.
What a pity Bilbo did not stab the vile creature, when he had a chance! Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and Mercy: not to strike without need.I do not feel any pity for Gollum. He deserves death.Deserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends.- The Two Towers p.601

Many are my names in many countries, he said. Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkun to the Dwarves; Olorin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incanus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.- The Two Towers p. 655
