##### My Thoughts
We jump three years into the future, Darrow is struggling to find a place among his “Peers.” Political forces are on the move and Darrow is working on shifting them his way. Then he just blows everything wide open and decides to do things his way.

The body count will continue to rise right up to the last page. True to form the plot keeps twisting as well right up to the end. It's a fun ride. I don’t know if it makes for a particularly coherent story but it makes for a lot of cool scenes. It's a popcorn pleaser for sure.

I liked it better than the first one. What else can I say? I have a running joke with this series, typically the book has sequences or parts of it that are pretty similar to another book. Golden Son is no exception; it felt very much like Dune through much of the first. Later on we go full blown Starship Troopers which is ok. I like both of those books and I liked this one.
