##### My Thoughts
So this is the fourth time I think I have read this far in the series. I am still learning things from this book.

Jordan continues to impress me and ruin me for other book series. I have said it once and I will say it again. Book four is at the top of his game. While the previous entries he was slowly reaching his grove. In book four he is firing in all cylinders he doesn't miss a step here.

The reason I think book four is so great is each story arc is well done, well paced and has a fitting conclusion. Whereas the series goes on, story arcs begin to stretch out over multiple books and no meaningful conclusion is reached for some length of time. I guess you could say the weight of the ever increasing amount of characters and stories is its own downfall.

For now though the series is at a happy point. Characters are together and we don't have too many story arcs to weigh everything down.

One way he could have eased the weight of all the characters and story arcs is he could have killed more people. Thinking back through back four did anyone die?
- Rand's arc I think one of the first 4 wise ones we meet died.
- Perrin he lost a couple of his young two rivers companions that were named and the tuthan got attacked but none of the named characters died. Potential some of the village council? some of the tuthan? some of his named companions. Mats Family or I don't know now I sound like a terrible person.
- Nynave and Elayne did anyone die here they knocked out one of the black ajah and the Forsaken got away...
- Min and Siuan - Some unnamed Aes Sedai and Siuanâ€™s warder dies... oh and Hamer the Warder trainer got killed. Potential could have killed Leane or I don't know someone...

I guess all of our characters are really good people. I am just saying if a few more people got killed throughout the series it could have at least helped contain the critical mass of story arcs going into the future. Who am I kidding he would have just made more characters and story arcs even if people died.
