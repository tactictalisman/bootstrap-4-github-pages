##### My Thoughts
Back with the third and final volume of the Lord of the Rings, The Return of the King.

The attention to detail is what keeps blowing my mind in these volumes. Let me share one example.
The Riders of Rohan are traveling south to Gondor. They make a little camp for the night and by the way here we are going to explore a long forgotten group of woodland dwellers who happen to know a secret road built by the men from the west long ago. After they help out Rohan they are going to go back into their forests and fade away into history like the rest of the random things we run into. Such world building and attention to detail.

Every page turn we run into thousands of years of lost forgotten history and there is no time to go explore because literally civilization is going to be destroyed if we don’t hurry our horses up.

Its just epic every page turn is epic. Sure the language is hard to understand sometimes. People just don’t talk like this anymore or write like this anymore. You could rename these books The Tour of Middle by the fellowship of the ring and other friends.

It is such a long epic it's amazing how much closure has been written into the final chapters. We spend a hundred pages saying goodbye to these characters we have gone through so much with. I think in some small part the author was slowly trying to let go and say goodbye, to him most of all, these characters must have meant so much.

Never forget Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.
