##### My Thoughts
The great thing about Knife of Dreams is story arcs start to end. Or stuff actually happens or move forward Perrin finds Faile. Aram dies. Galina is still stuck with the Shadio. Mat and Tuon get married, or finish proposing. Rand gets his hand blown off. Thom gets a note from his girl friend wait was that the last book. Elayne gets a crown. Loial gets married. Galad kills someone.

Egwene is still stuck in the Tower. Ok no resolution there, other than that everyone is progressing. The book is good. Characters, main characters actually do somethings. I mean some of these story arcs were two and three books old. Its well done. Robert Jordan does a good job. Oh and the cover art is some what wanting.
