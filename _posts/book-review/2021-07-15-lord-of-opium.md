title: Lord of Opium by Nancy Farmer
---

A rare feat for a sequel to be just as good if not better than the first.

- **Pages**: 405

##### My Thoughts
A rare feat for a sequel to be just as good if not better than the first. Lord of Opium I think is better than the first in all respects. The story arc, the pacing, and organization of the story was all around better.

Our good friend Matt is struggling with the responsibilities of running a drug empire along with all the other moral quagmire of post apocalyptic life. His struggles are real. The losses are real and this was just top notch fiction. The conclusion is satisfying and ties up very nicely.

I would definitely recommend this one and of course the House of the Scorpion before it.
