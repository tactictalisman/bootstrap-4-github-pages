title: A Princess of Mars by Edgar Rice Burroughs

Yep the book is better than the movie.

- **Title**: A Princess of Mars
- **Author**: Edgar Rice Burroughs
- **Published**: 1917
- **Genre**: Science Fiction
- **Pages**: 283 (Hardback)
- **Series**: [A Princess of Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Princess_of_Mars)
- **Film**: [John Carter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlvYKl1fjBI)

##### My Thoughts (Spoilers)

John Carter is transported to mars where he fights and lives among the green men of mars. Until he meets Dejah Thoris who he falls in love with and we spend the rest of the book chasing and rescuing the girl until they finally get married at the end.

I went into A Princess of Mars, having been a big fan of the movie, with a lot of excitement. The book of course flowed a lot better and made a lot more sense than the movie. There were a lot of glimpses into a bigger world and while not the most unique story it was very I am sure an incredible read for its time. The story was entertaining and a solid foundation of science fiction material.
