##### My Thoughts
I like the Stormlight Archive. I have enjoyed both books published to this point. Now that being said there is definitely some problems with this books. I feel book two suffers near the middle Kaladin's character definitely feels out of character I feel there is several sections in the middle that didn’t belong. Someone I don’t know maybe his editor needed to say you need to slim these sections down.

Another thing I have thought since I read the first one is the interlude chapters while awesome distract from the story. I feel an outrigger published in between each book would be more appropriate than the sometimes sideline stories that don’t progress the plot or add to it other than fleshing out the world at large.

I find book two very interesting in that it reads fast you want to know what is going to happen. The Shallan story arc is very well done. Adolin is brought in and done very well. I mentioned that Kaladin’s chapters suffer I think in the middle of the book. I feel like maybe he had an ending in mind and he knew all the characters would be there and had good paths for everyone except for maybe Kaladin. Other than do some guard duty and mop around for 800 pages. He does have a couple cool moments.

Now my brother was talking to someone who was talking to Brandon. Really good source right. Brandon said book two was alright nothing special wait till you see what comes in book 3. Now who knows if this is true or not but I definitely felt like book 2 was a little bit of a filler. If he admitted as much and was excited for book 3 well that just makes me excited. I liked WOR it adds a lot of explanation to the magic systems that we were lacking in WOK. Long though a little bit too long again those sections in the middle just seemed a little crammed in for no other reason. Someone needs to help kill those darlings.
