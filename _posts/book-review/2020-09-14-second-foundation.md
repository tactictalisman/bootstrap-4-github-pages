##### My Thoughts (spoilers ahead)
An exciting conclusion to some of the questions and events that took place in the previous book, Foundation and Empire. The Mule is back and still on his search for the second foundation. I really enjoyed the twists and guessing I was doing right up to the end of part one. I really love that you are given enough hints to guess what is happening but as a reader you donâ€™t have all the information. 

The second part of the book deals with the foundation searching for the second foundation. It is equally satisfying as the search plays out differently and the clues lead the characters on while you are guessing and searching along with them. Then in the end you find that the second foundation has set up the same game that they did with the mule. Leaving clues and hints but always behind smoke and mirrors. The setup is awesome and the pay off is great.

I loved the ending and you know it's a good book when you reach the end and go ah wait I need to reread this now.
