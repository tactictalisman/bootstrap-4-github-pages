##### My Thoughts
I absorbed this book. The first three hundred or so pages I was claiming it was the best thing I have read since Speaker for the Dead(which is one of my favorite if not my favorite book). So high praise as I was reading through. That ending though, I don’t know. It just, well, it ends on a question mark for me really. I think I need to read the next book before I can really give it praise.

Don’t get me wrong the book is amazing. It just hits the ending and I am not sure if he wiped out the first three books or not. It's really good but the ending makes me feel like this book is the sum of greater things to come. So with that in mind I will get reading the next one and reserve judgement until then.
