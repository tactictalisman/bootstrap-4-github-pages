Spoiler Warning

##### My Thoughts
Reading through this time I really feel this book is mainly a Rand and Nynaeve book. Not only do we get a lot from their point of view, surrounding chapters usually are dealing directly with one or the other. I guess every chapter is usually dealing with Rand this early on but you know.

A really neat set up of back to back chapters dealing with Nynaeve is Ch. 22 Watchers from Moraine POV this chapter is well looking at the book as a whole the only real Moiraine and Lan in the book 2. The whole chapter is amazing. It's so great to get a Moiraine perspective here. The thing that is interesting is this chapter sets up Lan and Nynaeve story for the rest of the series. Moiraine knows Lan has fallen for Nynaeve. The whole chapter is so full of emotion. Then in Ch. 23 Testing from Nynaeve's perspective we get her feelings about Lan at the end of her test. So we have two people in love, both of them bound by duty and conflicted for they still want to be together.

All in all a great set up here for Lan and Nynaeve continuing story arc through out the rest of the series.

One thing I don’t get as excited about as much as I use to is Rand’s duel with Tarak at the end. I remember reading this the first time just being blown away. It was so tense and the fact that Rand gains the status he does after the duel is really great. I think I was really focused on all the other characters this read through where and what they are doing. I used to think book two was a little slow. Now though I think several of these chapters are some of my fondest memories.
