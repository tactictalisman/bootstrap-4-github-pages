##### My Thoughts

The layers, so many layers. I guessed about two maybe touched on the third. Isaac Asimov still continues not to disappoint. The book was great. What more can I say.

I was talking to my wife and I told her I think I can guess a few things coming. I think I know what's going down and I know where this is all going. Right up to the end Asimov is still schooling my thought patterns. He is a very good writer. From Foundation he has only aged like a fine wine.

So when I first started reading the Foundation series I found a reading order for the books that I have called into question multiple times. I have been reading roughly in publication order leaving the prequels to the end. Even reading through the prequel I was though I donâ€™t know these might be read in a different order. After finishing now I can say the reading order I have roughly followed has been good for the different plot twists and reveals.
