title: Foundation by Isaac Asimov
---

How this amazing book eluded me for so long is the real question.

- **Title**: Foundation
- **Author**: Isaac Asimov
- **Published**: 1951
- **Genre**: Science Fiction
- **Pages**: 244
- **Series**: [Foundation Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series)
- **Film**: [Foundation Tv Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series))

##### My Thoughts
So I pick it up and I am reading the quotes on the back of the book. People are gushing saying things like, The greatest science fiction author ever, etc. Wow that is pretty big declaration I guess you could say. I have read a lot of really good science fiction. So let's see where this lands.

After getting about half way through the book I can tell you I am a believer. It's top tier science fiction. It's well written and easily compares with my favorite science fiction books. I am surprised its taken me this long to hear about it. I guess I am not out there actively searching for good book lists or anything I have my own long list of books I would like to get around too.

##### Spoilers
Hari Seldon has predicted the imminent clapse of the galactic empire and the impending thirty thousand year dark age that will grip humanity. In an effort to curb the long downfall of human kind he plans a course to save humanity from itself.

Foundation, the book, let's us peer into the critical events as they unfold across the ages to rebuild what was lost.
