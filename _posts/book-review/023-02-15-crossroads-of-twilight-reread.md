##### Summary

Ending for each story arc.
Rand is hanging out in Tear. Mat barely manages to kill one of the sul'dam who escaped. Perrin throws his ax away. Egwene is betrayed and captured by the tower.

##### My Thoughts
Crossroads of Twilight is a fun book. 
Everyone is settling into their roles. I think my favorite sequences are Mat’s chapters it's a lot of fun to read.

By page 500 we are finished catching up with everyone and only a day has gone by. We see only a chapter or two of Rand. I think this is the book where everyone kind of said seriously Jordan you have to end this sometime.

After reading through you could argue that this is the book that nothing happens. While there isn’t a huge battle at the ending I think all the story arcs progress in meaningful ways.

Oh and I love the cliffhanger ending with Egwene.
