##### My Thoughts
Oh book 5 how I love and hate you. For years now I went on and on about how book five was the low point of the series and just a rough book all around. Reading through it again almost 15 or, I guess, 20 years later I have a lot better opinion of book 5. The biggest thing you need to frame in your mind going into book five is that this is not a book about Rand, Mat, or Perrin. In fact Perrin or anyone around him doesn't even have a point of view in this book. He just isn't.

Book five is all about the girls story arcs. Nynaeve, Elayne, Egwene, Avinedha, Moraine, Siuan, and even the Maidens of the Spear. So I think you're going to enjoy this book a whole lot more if you just know up front this book is all about the girls. A lot of people I introduce to the series end up stopping at book five or never finishing it. I think it's because book five isn't about the three main characters we have had in the series up to now the tone shifts.

The start and tone of book five is very different from book four I noticed. The character descriptions just feel a little out of place. At a lot of points I felt like Jordan was just trolling the reader. I mean parts where Nynave and Elayne join the circus. The constant build up to action and then cutting the chapter or pov right as things start. I don't know, he was definitely jerking people around. 

Again another reason I think people fall flat on this book is the length. I mean it's a large book and we spend so much page time on seemingly pointless things. I think at one point around page 800 I turned to my wife and said I can give you detailed descriptions of these 3 refugees taking the boat down the river with Nynave and Elayne. Yet we couldn't get any more detail of Mat's action in and around Cairhenion during the battles? Like I said this book is all about the girl's travels, just make sure you remember that as you're reading through.

All in all, some really great moments here. The scenes where Lanfear is so jealous that she gets herself killed is good. We are introduced to Salidar and I think that is an interesting story arc.

All of this is leading up to The Lord of Chaos, book six is amazing so here we go.
