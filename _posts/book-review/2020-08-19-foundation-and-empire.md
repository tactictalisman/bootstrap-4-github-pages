Just as good as the first one, which is a high praise.

- **Series**: [The Foundation Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series)

##### My Thoughts
Sitting here 75 years after the book came out it's almost ridiculous to say how amazing it is.

Another line of thought I had was how some of these themes seem to resonate today. The idea of an Empire being a superpower past it's prime seems like an oft repeated representation of the United States in this day and age. 

Then in the second half of the book the idea of wealth and power consolidation leading to a civil war that never quit takes place because bigger problems are always looming.

The whole thing just resenanted with the present day. I think perhaps the themes in the book may be timeless because in 25 or 50 more years I can only see these ideas continuing to be present throughout the world.

Foundation and Empire is brilliant. I can't tell which is better the second one or the first one. I will reserve judgement until I finish the series.
