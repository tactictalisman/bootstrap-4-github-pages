Book Two, in Sandersons The Reckoners series, has all the feels.

##### My Thoughts

It is rare for sequel to stand up to the original. It is even rare for a sequel to eclipse the original. To take a formula and give it an exciting fresh perspective while at the same time sticking to the world and rules you set up in the original. Sanderson stuck the landing on this one.

Now I liked Steelheart, the first book in the series, I thought it was well written. Firefight keeps everything I loved about the first book and matures it. Now realizing these are still young adult novels and you have certain limitations that come along with that audience. The characters are still themselves while having room to grow. The chemistry works so well with the different characters. The twists are spot on not rushed or forced.

All around a great read. I hope the last book in the series finishes just as strong as these two have.
