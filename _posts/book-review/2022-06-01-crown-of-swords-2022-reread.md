##### My Thoughts
We start in thick with cleaning up from Dumai's Well and establishing how everyone is dealing with that event. Perrin is the overarching point of view in all of this. And it quickly starts to drag on. I was thinking about it and Perrins and Faile story is a lot like a couple of High schoolers relationship. Faile is always jealous and Perrin is always confused. They are on again and off again. They love hard and fight hard. Perrins, what I like to call a second camping trip, is a slog to read and they are just setting out here.

Nynaeve and Lan are finally back together.

Matt, Elyane and Nynaeve are looking for the bowl of the winds in Ebu Dar. The girls discover the Kin. After finding the location of the bowl they are attacked by a Gholam when they go to get it.

Rand fights Padin Fain, who has been absent since book 4 for the most part. Also Rand sort of jumps Sammaul they fight in Shadar Logoth and Sammael  gets killed by Mashader.


##### My Thoughts

We shift from the Aes Sedai being mystical figures to understanding a lot more about them. How strong they are, how long they live, how they compare to each other and their hierarchy. No stone is left unturned.

I felt like this was a rough book. The Perrin and Rand sequences feel slow and awkward. I loved Egwenes and the Ebu Dar group were exciting to read. I feel like Jordan must have run out of time and stapled on the ending. Then spoiler in book 8 we get the real ending of the book with the bowl and the fixing the weather sequence.
