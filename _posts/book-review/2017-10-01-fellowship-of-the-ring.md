##### My Thoughts
It has been nearly 15 years since I read the Lord of the Rings. The book is so well written. You will be reading along and someone will mention a name in passing. If you want you can get online and read up on a whole back story about this name of a person or place. The lore and history is so rich it just feels so real and immersive.

Reading through this time I really enjoyed the sequence as they passed through Moria. Hearing about the Dwarfs and the history of their people was very interesting. I had forgotten about a lot of it. So as they pass through the mines of Moria and you learn more and more about their history it culminates with a scene of Glimi and Frodo stepping up to the Mirrormere and looking into the reflection of the lake. The lake reflects the mountain tops and the stars in the sky. Then it talks about how that is the crown of Durin. It's a quick scene but just incredible touch and thought provoking.

The Fellowship of the Ring was an awesome read. It takes you on a journey through Middle Earth. You get a first hand history tour through much of the lands. I can't recommend it enough.
