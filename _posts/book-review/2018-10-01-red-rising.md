##### My Thoughts
Red Rising is a story about revenge at its core. Our young hero Darrow has a deadly encounter with society's ruling class. Bent on revenge he will do anything to bring down the regime that hurt him and those he loves. Red Rising resembles the Count of Monte Cristo in all its forms. Our hero learns first hand what it means to love and hate. He experiences both friendship and betrayal. All of this taking place over the backdrop of a Hunger Games esque sequence of bloody warfare justified as a game.

I enjoyed this book. It started out slow and disjointed. I kept with it the pace picked up and the story ended up being quite good. This is young adult fiction and I couldn’t stop but think this book is borrowed from all the other popular dystopian young adult series out there today. If you even had a passable enjoyment for Hunger Games, Divergent, or the Maze Runner you would probably like Red Rising. It also has elements of Harry Potter and Ender’s Game with The Count of Monte Cristo in space, dominating it all. 

As of this writing I haven’t read the next entry in the series. I am looking forward to it and excited to see how things end up.
