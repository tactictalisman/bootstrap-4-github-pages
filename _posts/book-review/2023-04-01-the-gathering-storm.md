##### My Thoughts
Quick thought experiment here let's look at who is in Rands Head
Rand Himself
The Voice of Lews Therin Telamon
Alanna Bonded him as a warder
Avenida bonded
Min bonded
Elayne bonded
Sees Perrin by thinking about him or talking about him.
Sees Mat by thinking about him or talking about him.
Mordin body and mind is connected to Rand.

I really enjoy The Gathering Storm. Egwene's story in the tower is one of my favorites. I can’t get enough of her comeback story here. When she is meeting with the Aes Sedai outside the tower in the world of dreams and tells them not to come get her. Its such a great moment of who she is and what she believes in the tower. Can’t get enough.

Rand I think is well written here. It's nice to see him progress, It's nice to see him getting even worse so to speak. The conflict is good for him instead of just brooding which feels like what he has been doing the last few books.

Looking forward to the next one lots of great scenes here as Brandon begins to wrap up the story. Its nice to see story arcs ending and closing and I think it hurts that we can’t expand more on a lot of great new characters that show up in the last three books but it had to end somehow.
