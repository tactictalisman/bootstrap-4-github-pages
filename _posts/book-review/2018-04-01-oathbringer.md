Spoiler Warning

##### My Thoughts
Spoiler Alert, I will be covering all the things I liked and spoiling the story along the way so if you haven't read the book you might want to pass this review up.
So I am going to dive right in and give you my thoughts. After reading each section of the book I wrote down a few thoughts.

Section 1
So much information comes out in this first section. It feels like an extended epilogue from the last book. Catching up with everyone where they are at and adjusting to the changes at the end of the last book. The pacing is better than in book two and actually comes to a neat conclusion. I haven’t finished the book yet but it would seem this was sort of Shallan's section; she was the focus for the most part. A lot of things come together and it's quite a good self-contained story. On to the next section.

Section 2
Keeping in mind that I really enjoyed The Way of Kings (WOK) I felt Moashs story really picking up here with a way of kings-esque feel. I would have loved a little more from him but that story was already told in WOK.

Section 3
The climax for section 3 is really good. As everything converges on Kholinar. I felt like an entire book could have been written about the siege on Kholinar. We get the reader's digest version and skip on to other things. So much is going on so many characters converge. It's good.
Two things really stood out in this section. Most notably is finding out about Dalinar's past and what happened to his wife. An emotional and sobering event which is coupled with the fact that Dalinar didn’t even remember it or know about it until that moment. A neat way to write that is having a character discovering his past at the same time you do. It makes all the emotions very raw.
The other thing was Kaladin’s battle shock as they were fighting at the palace in Kholinar. Seeing all of those competing groups fighting against each other. It was interesting to see his reaction.

Section 4
Again as we enter Shadesmar I couldn't help but feel like an entry book could have been devoted here. I can't imagine what has been left on the editing room floor.

Section 5
A fitting end for an amazing book. I think right there at the end we were seeing Brandon Sanderson sitting down to write. I think we got to see a little bit into his soul as Dalinar begins to pen his book. We see Brandon’s own passion for writing. It starts to speak volumes as you think about the meaning of the words for the author and the characters all wrapped together.

Better than the second I felt. I really connected with this book. Better than the Way of Kings? I don't know. I need to read it again. I hear a lot of people say it's better the second time. There is just so much information being dumped on you all the time it's hard to process it all if you're at all distracted.
