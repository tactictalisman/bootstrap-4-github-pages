##### My Thoughts
I don’t know why I have to have all these disclaimers to explain my thoughts about this book but here we go.

First this is the last book I read of the foundation series. I read the series in publication order. I was very sceptical at first that the publication order would be the best order to read through the series but it turned out to be a good order to read in. So I will give my thoughts on this book and then some overall reaction to the whole series here.

Forward the Foundation is a victory lap. The author is 70 years old and from what I can tell this book was published right after he passed away. With that in mind the main character reads very methodically as time passes. Each character in the book gets a hundred page story to say goodbye in a sense. I liked how Forward the Foundation played out. I think it was a good last book to read so to speak.

As far as the foundation series as a whole I really enjoyed the whole series. Throughout I felt the author really respected you as a reader. He didn’t slap you over the head with clues and hints. The stories were concise and to the point. The climaxes worked and always felt satisfying. My only regret is not having heard of or read this series sooner.
