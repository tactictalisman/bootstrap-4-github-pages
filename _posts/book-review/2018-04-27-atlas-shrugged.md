##### My Thoughts
Atlas Shrugged follows a young railroad tycoon, Dagny Taggert, as she struggles to discover her true philosophical compass. With the backdrop of a dystopian United States working towards socializing industry and thought. She works to keep her railroad empire from collapsing while searching for answers to the questions: Who is John Galt? and How is he going to stop the motor of the world?

Initially I had a really hard time with this book. I started it and got a couple hundred pages in and I just wasn’t interested at the time. A couple years went by and I picked it up again and pushed through it. After my initially slow start I really enjoyed this book. The story was excellent, the characters were all very interesting and everything wrapped up in an interesting conclusion. I can’t type up my feelings for Atlas Shrugged in a couple paragraphs though. There is so much going on in this novel.

To keep it short it is an interesting philosophy, objectivism, that is presented here. At times the author bashes you over the head repeatedly with the same ideas presented over and over and over from only a slightly different angle. And of course if you're familiar with the novel the lengthy monologue towards the end of the book that stretches some 60 pages is just mind boggling. Other than these I think it is very well written and an excellent book. I think everyone should read it at least once for the perspective of it all.
