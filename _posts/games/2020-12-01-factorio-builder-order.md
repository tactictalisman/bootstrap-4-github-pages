Title: Factorio Build Order
---

The build order presented here is a rough outline of what you can expect. Factorio is a balancing act of priorities and you canâ€™t plan for everything.

#### Words of wisdom from reddit user /u/talrich

Namaste. You seek balance. Here is my wisdom. Your mistakes have no cost but time, and the deconstruction planner even reduces that cost. Most games punish you for building, demolishing and rebuilding. Not Factorio. Let your anxiety wash away as you perceive that every belt placed can be moved. Every assembler is but a visitor to where it resides. The only significance is life, which leads to the further wisdom. Look both ways before you cross the tracks.
