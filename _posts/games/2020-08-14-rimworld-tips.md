title: Rimworld Tips and Trick
---
Your not in Kansas anymore, you're on Pandora... out there beyond that fence every living thing that crawls, flies, or squats in the mud wants to kill you and eat your eyes for jujubeans.

A few tips and tricks other notes thing I like to remember when playing Rimworld.

##### Shelter
- Use Zones to control who can leave the base so people don't go for walks out in unprotected areas.
- Once established build a bug out shelter on the other side of the map. Stock it with a few stacks of essentials.
  - Stack of Survival Meals
  - Medicine
  - Gun
  - Wood
  - two bed rolls
  - hat and jacket(biome dependant)

##### Food
- Use simple meals only if you have access to one type of food (meat or veggies).
- Use fine meals they use (5meat/5veggies) where as simple just uses a stack of 10 of what you have.
- Rough estimate a colonist eating two meals a day will need 750 units of food a season. (still need to check this one)

##### Security/Comabat
- Raids, counter with a killbox and short range weapons
- Sappers, counter attack use smokesreens for cover or build walls to slow down.
- Siege, counter with mortar or counterattack with smokescreen to cover.
- Posian Ship,
- Mechs, counter with a killbox, smokescreen cover and emps.
- Mech ship, counterattack with smokesreen to cover longe range snipers.
- Insects
- When attacking bases use smokescreen to cover snipers, have a medic for backup.

##### Clothes
- At game start set clothes restriction to 50 - 100 percent. To stop tattered clothing debuff.

##### Animals
- Pigs can eat corpses. Keep them in a freezer so they don't spoil. (Good for a cold biome)

##### War Crimes
- Keep downed prisoners to sell as slaves, release for mood bounus, or organ harvesting.
