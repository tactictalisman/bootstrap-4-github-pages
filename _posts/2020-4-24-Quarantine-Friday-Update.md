title: Quarantine Week 6 Friday Update
---

Quarantine week six or at least the sixth week I have been working remote from home.

##### Scale Models
I made some serious progress on the tiger this week. I got half the wheels put together and started the photo etch tool latches. I am still staring down another side of track . The previous track took me maybe 12 hours to put together, hopefully this one goes a bit quicker.

##### Books
I started reading Starsight by Brandon Sanderson this week. Even though I am stuck at home I still can't quit find enough time to read.

##### Video Games
I got a little time in on EU4. I started a game playing Aragon with the goal to capture trade in the Mediterranean. I haven't played in so long lots of little things have changed. I was thinking about putting together a quick start guide to help me remember what things need to be set up at the start of the game.

Picked up two games during the steam midweek sale [Homeworld Remastered](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244160/Homeworld_Remastered_Collection/) and [Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak](https://store.steampowered.com/app/281610/Homeworld_Deserts_of_Kharak/). Both have been on my wish list for far to long. As always I don't know when I'll find time to play but when I do I am sure it will be a blast.

Stay safe out there.
