title: April Magic High and Low Friday Update
---

For these Friday updates I was thinking about covering one topic more specifically. Instead of brushing through bullets points of all the things I have been working on throughout the week.

I still want to leave my Friday updates open ended so I can cover whatever topic is of interest to that week. I don't want to set a schedule. For example fourth Friday of the month is magic week or something like that. Assigning a topic to the week ruins the fluid concept I am going for.

With all that being said I think I will try and limit these ramblings to a couple topics.

##### April Magic
In the middle of March I was watching Khans [Fetch Lands](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Afetchland) pretty close as I had some birthday cash I wanted to spend. As the world was shutting down fetch lands dropped lower and lower. I was waiting for the slight uptick to see if we had reached the bottom of the drop and on April 1st the price came back up a little. So I pulled the trigger and picked up what I had planned to get.

The month went on and prices started to increase. Not just on fetches but all sorts of commander staples, older cards. Different buyouts where happening right and left at first I thought it was just constrained supply. Cardkingdom was dripping out cards and tcgplayer direct was turned off.

As the weeks kept going by prices and buyouts kept happening, stimulus checks had started reaching peoples bank accounts and so everything has reached a sort of perfect storm.

The other thing to factor in was the increased excitement around the spoiler season of [C20](https://scryfall.com/sets/c20) and [IKO](https://scryfall.com/sets/iko). All of these combined has made for one wild ride in April. Demand is high as everyone is flush with cash. Supply is definitely constrained as everything has slowed to a crawl.

I still had some birthday cash I wanted to pick up a few things I think I am going to step back until the dust settles on this one. No reason for me to be buying into this uptick. If anything I need to pull out my binders and check over the buy lists.

Stay safe out there.
