title: Quarantine Week 8 Coming to an End - Friday Update
---

Description

Quarantine is coming to an end. I think I will be back to work next week. It's been a busy week with life. Plants needing to go in the garden, things need fixing around the house. I haven't had a lot of spare time for hobbies which I feel is pretty standard for the warmer months of the year.

When I happen to catch a few moments I have been grinding my way through the [Homeworld](https://store.steampowered.com/app/244160/Homeworld_Remastered_Collection/) campaign. What a treat it's been. Why did it take 20 years for me to find this game? If you enjoy RTS(real time strategy) games I would definitely suggest picking it up. Wait for a sale on steam you will be in around 6 to 7 dollars.

I have been brewing magic decks almost nonstop in my head. You know when you get an itch you just can't stop. I had a few 5 color deck ideas tumbling around my head all week. I've got everything down on paper. When I find a few minutes I will post a deck list and a quick write up. It's all the big five color spells and commanders in one deck. It's a janky Timmy mess but it puts a smile on my face. So that's why I am thinking of calling it Thanos's battle crusier lunch box. Like I say I will post it when I have a chance.

Another deck brew I have been narrowing down is this Yawgmoth zombie tribal deck now this deck I am actually building in paper. Once I get it smoothed out I will post a deck list too.

Hope everyone is staying safe out there. Remember to find some time for a little fun during the week. Catch you later.
