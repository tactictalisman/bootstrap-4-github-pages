#### Theme
We all have that deck we built it, it didn’t do what we wanted but we kept it around anyway. Tweaking it, changing it until it looks totally different than what you originally had started out trying to do. When I first started building this deck it was a zombie token deck. It didn’t work, at least not the way I was approaching it.
The current deck is a dredge, self-mill deck where you then use goyf style creatures to swing big. It's a casual deck with a fun go tall strategy. The deck was made a couple years ago and could really use some tuning.

#### Strategy
As always feel free to sub in what cards you have on hand. The general strategy here is to fill the graveyard up. Instead of drawing cards we want to fill the yard up with mill effects.

We can then use recursion effects to get out what we need. Using our graveyard like a second hand.

The win con here is to get out a gofy whose power is based on the amount of creatures in the graveyard. With a Wonder or Brawn we can then overtop any blockers and swing in for lots of damage.

This particular deck is a slow burn that takes time to get running. As you begin to mill, use Sidisi’s zombie tokens to block or sac for profit. Using recursion abilities to start setting up your board or getting utility cards or removal while continuing to set up.

#### Notable Combos
With <auto-card>Sidisi, Brood Tyrant</auto-card> out and <auto-card>Path of Discovery</auto-card> results in a lot of cards in the yard and a stack of zombie tokens.
