##### Theme
A pretty straight forward zurgo deck. Get Zurgo out, board wipe and swing in for commander damage. A heavy emphasis on instants and sources as we try to keep our board state to a minimum as the goal is to board wipe each turn.

Strong against creature focused decks. Weak against removal as zurgo is easily removed from the field on other turns this really sets you back as he gets quite expensive. Which has you looking for the same lines each game either Darksteel Plate or Boris Charm to try and protect zurgo until your next turn comes around.

##### Game Plan
Ramp up and play equipment, get Zurgo on the board and start swinging. Board wipe and swing.

##### Notbale Combos
<auto-card>Sunforger</auto-card>&#43;Instants(like <auto-card>Chaos Warp</auto-card>, <auto-card>Dispatch</auto-card>, <auto-card>Seize the Day</auto-card> to name a few).

Pretty straight forward idea with Sunforger using our suit of instants and sorceries we have access to all sorts of utility.

<auto-card>Zurgo Helmsmasher</auto-card>&#43;<auto-card>Worldslayer</auto-card>

With Zurgo online and attaching Worldslayer we have a great one sided board wipe on our turn. Note that Worldslayer will destory everyones lands, so with great power comes great responsible.
