#### Theme
This Surrak deck is a list I scraped together from things I had lying around in binders. I picked up maybe twenty dollars of cards to bring it together. It’s not very strong though it is an easy straight forward deck to pilot. A perfect deck for me to hand to new players and beginners without having to teach them anything too complicated. Well except I threw in some counterspells. You gotta learn sometime.

#### Strategy
##### Early Game
Most of the ramp focuses on getting more lands into play so we can get the most out of our mana doubling spells once they come online.
- <auto-card-image>Zhur-Taa Ancient</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>Nikya of the Old Ways</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>Zendikar Resurgent</auto-card-image>

All of our card draw is based around creatures in fact so much so we probably either need more creatures or we need to drop some of these for some low cmc blue draw spells.
- <auto-card-image>Guardian Project</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>Beast Whisperer</auto-card-image>

Get things set up for our big boys with some haste enablers like <auto-card-image>Temur Ascendancy</auto-card-image>, <auto-card-image>Rhythm of the Wild</auto-card-image>, <auto-card-image>Surrak, The Hunt Caller</auto-card-image>.

Also some protection  <auto-card-image>Temur Sabertooth</auto-card-image>, <auto-card-image>Spearbreaker Behemoth</auto-card-image>, <auto-card-image>Soul of New Phyrexia</auto-card-image>.

##### Mid Game
A hint of control, if other players creatures are getting out of hand we aren’t running much of a board wipe package because we got our own creatures we want to keep around. So we can copy or steal there creatures to work against them.

- <auto-card-image>Clever Impersonator</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>Yasova Dragonclaw</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>Conquering Manticore</auto-card-image>

Also if our mana doublers aren’t online yet we have some other cheat options available.
- <auto-card-image>Wild Pair</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>Sunbird's Invocation</auto-card-image>
- <auto-card-image>See the Unwritten</auto-card-image>

##### Late Game
Our big boys can start hitting the ground. Again these are just a random smattering of cards I happen to have in my binder. Look for creatures that give you some extra benefit when they enter the board or swing not just raw power. For example <auto-card-image>Desolation Twin</auto-card-image> gives a copy of himself. <auto-card-image>Giant Adephage</auto-card-image> is giving us a copy when he hits a player.

Closing the game. Our win con is in our command zone. <auto-card-image>Surrak Dragonclaw</auto-card-image> will give all our creatures trample so we can swing in for damage regardless of creatures stand in our way. <auto-card-image>End-Raze Forerunners</auto-card-image> is a back up option to give us trample and swing in.

While its not the most tricked out deck ever its using up cards I had sitting around in a binder. Sometimes you need a lower powered deck at some tables or to teach someone else how to play.
