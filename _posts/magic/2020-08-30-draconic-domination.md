#### Theme
The first commander deck I ever owned. It is a mash up of different cards I have gotten or traded into. The core of the deck is the C17 Draconic Domination. The land base of course needs tuning and all around a little rough around the edges. The current list has a lot of tribal synergies in it. If I find some time and money I may upgrade it one day.

#### Strategy
A pretty straight forward creature strategy. Play dragons and attack with them. The deck is a slow burn with lots of board wipes to keep your opponents back until you can start dropping dragons.

##### Early Game
A full suite of green ramp spells help us to fix and get up and running including <auto-card>Rampant Growth</auto-card>, <auto-card>Farseek</auto-card>, <auto-card>Cultivate</auto-card>, <auto-card>Kodama's Reach</auto-card>.

The current draw cards I have in the deck is a little slow and needs some tuning. A few of the ones I have will reward you for casting dragons. <auto-card>Vanquisher's Banner</auto-card>, <auto-card>Temur Ascendancy</auto-card>, <auto-card>Distant Melody</auto-card>, <auto-card>Kindred Discovery</auto-card>.

##### Mid Game
If we are able to get enough ramp going in the first couple turns we should be able to start casting dragons. Usually this will result in you being able to cast one per turn. Look for haste enablers to get them swinging to make an impact. <auto-card>Temur Ascendancy</auto-card>, <auto-card>Lightning Greaves</auto-card>, <auto-card>Dragon Tempest</auto-card>, <auto-card>Kindred Discovery</auto-card>.

##### Late Game
If you can survive long enough and or protect the dragons you play you will eventually reach a critical mass of dragons. A board full of hug flyers will beat down an enemy pretty quickly.
If you are able to get <auto-card>The Ur-Dragon</auto-card> and he doesnâ€™t get destroyed he will typically win you the game between his draw and play a card ability or just the raw power of a flyer with 10/10. He typically gets target and removed very quickly so he is best to use as a potential threat. If you have a haste enabler he can be very impactful if he makes it through a round of combat.
