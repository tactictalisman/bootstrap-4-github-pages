title: Friday Update #1
---

Quarantine continues I was thinking about making an update post every Friday to help me organize my thoughts and get in the habit of posting again.

### Magic
As far as this week's endeavors I finally pulled the trigger and picked up [Yawgmoth, Thran Physician](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/116/yawgmoth-thran-physician). He had been trending down in price for the last couple months when I noticed he bottomed out at around 10 on tcgplayer. Then I noticed cardkingdom had him for 9.99 and tcgplayer had bumped to around 13 so it felt like a bottom for now.

As a whole the market seems to be stabilizing after last months drop from the pandemic. I checked Khan's Fetches this morning and they had all up ticked 2 to 3 dollars on tcgplayer from their lows two weeks ago. Note stimulus checks landed in accounts the past couple days.

What the future holds is anyone's guess for mtg markets.

### Scale Models
I finished up the weld seams on my tiger 1 and have moved on to preparing the wheels to be glued hopefully I find time to post some pictures.

### Books
I started reading Starsight by Brandon Sanderson this week. Even though I am stuck at home I still can't quit find enough time to read.

### Video Games
Not much to talk about here my wife has needed the PC at nights to work so I haven't had any time to get on.

I am thinking about playing some EU4 if I can get some time in.


Quarantine drags on I have been home from work for five weeks now I think. Starting to lose track. It looks like at least another couple weeks before I can get back.

Stay safe out there.
