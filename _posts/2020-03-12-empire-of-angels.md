##### Theme

Original this deck came about, as I wanted to build a deck for my wife. She does not really care for some of the creepy art that some of the cards have so I thought a green white token flavor might be in order. Then listening to Empire of Angels from two steps from hell gave me some inspirational energy.

What about a go wide token deck with a little bit of a twist? Instead of 1/1 tokens what if we went wide with 4/4 flying angel tokens with vigilance. As I started brewing (Sigil of the Empty Throne) stuck out as a key piece. Being in Green and white a natural enchantment theme started to emerge until I embraced it fully. An enchantment deck that wanted to fill the board with 4/4 flying angels with a touch of life gain.

The deck is a slow burn we play very defensively building our board state of enchantment goodness until we can strike from a position of strength.

##### Phase One: Call the Heavens
Get the enchantment draw engine up and running. If we get a token engine up, play [Trostani, Selesnya's Voice](https://scryfall.com/card/gk1/102/trostani-selesnyas-voice) to populate and gain life. [Enchantress's Presence](https://scryfall.com/card/c18/141/enchantresss-presence) being the quintessential draw engine for the Enchantress theme.

##### Phase Two: An Empty Throne
Focus on enter the board effects to gain value. Using either enchantments or creatures entering the board to gain life, create tokens, or draw cards. [Sigil of the Empty Throne](https://scryfall.com/card/c18/74/sigil-of-the-empty-throne) being our all star effect here.

##### Phase Three: Double or Nothing
Double up with more tokens. Even when board wipes happen, you can bounce back quickly. Hold a token engine in reserve in your hand so when one is wiped you can drop down another. Once a doubler comes into play you can continue to profit. [Anointed Procession](https://scryfall.com/card/akh/2/anointed-procession), [Parallel Lives](https://scryfall.com/card/isd/199/parallel-lives), or [Primal Vigor](https://scryfall.com/card/c13/162/primal-vigor).
