title: Scrambled Dinosaur Eggs
---

Its time for breakfast with Atla Palani's dinosaur scrambled eggs.

- **Commander:** [Atla Palani, Nest Tender](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/38/atla-palani-nest-tender)
- **Colors:** RGW (Red, Green, White) 
- **Ranking:** 5 out of 10
- **Deck:** [Archidekt](https://archidekt.com/decks/529646#Dinosaurs)

##### Theme
A casual dinosaur tribal theme that uses self damage to pop Atla's eggs and tries to get the most out of the enrage mechanic. You can also comfortable run [Gishath, Sun's Avatar](https://scryfall.com/card/xln/222/gishath-suns-avatar) as the commander.

##### Phase One: Feeding Time
Ramping up is our first priority. Currently this deck is running the full suite of Signets and Talismans. Along with [Cultivate](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/159/cultivate), [Farseek](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/165/farseek), and [Rampant Growth](https://scryfall.com/card/dds/48/rampant-growth) to get things going. While using mana dorks might seem like a good idea I have excluded them to try and get the most out of popping Atla's eggs.

##### Phase Two: Time to get Cracking
Once our commander is online and pumping out eggs its time to get cracking. Now we can't rely on our opponents attacking us to pop eggs so we need to pop our own eggs.
- [Raging Swordtooth](https://scryfall.com/card/xln/226/raging-swordtooth)
- [Burning Sun's Avatar](https://scryfall.com/card/xln/135/burning-suns-avatar)
- [Marauding Raptor](https://scryfall.com/card/m20/150/marauding-raptor)
- [Forerunner of the Empire](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/102/forerunner-of-the-empire)

In a pinch we have a few other options to pop those eggs.
- [Beast Within](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/157/beast-within)
- [Star of Extinction](https://scryfall.com/card/xln/161/star-of-extinction)
- [Pyroclasm](https://scryfall.com/card/a25/146/pyroclasm)
- [Ghired's Belligerence](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/25/ghireds-belligerence)
- [Trove of Temptation](https://scryfall.com/card/xln/171/trove-of-temptation)
- [Thornbite Staff](https://scryfall.com/card/mor/145/thornbite-staff)

##### Phase Three: Enrage Boys
With all that damage being directed towards our own creatures we can also use the enrage mechanic on dinosaurs to profit.
- [Silverclad Ferocidons](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/115/silverclad-ferocidons)
- [Polyraptor](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/144/polyraptor)
- [Trapjaw Tyrant](https://scryfall.com/card/rix/29/trapjaw-tyrant)
- [Ripjaw Raptor](https://scryfall.com/card/xln/203/ripjaw-raptor)
- [Apex Altisaur](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/31/apex-altisaur)
