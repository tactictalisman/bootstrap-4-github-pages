### Theme

We all have that deck we built it, it didn't do what we wanted but we kept it around anyway. Tweaking it changing it until it looks total different than what you orginial had started out trying to do.

When I first started building this deck it was a zombie token deck. It didn't work at least not the way I approaching it.

The current deck is a dredge, self-mill deck where you then use goyf style creatures to swing big. Its a casual deck with a unique and fun go tall strategy.

### Strategy
#### Phase One: Fill the Yard
Use your self mill and dredge abilites to fill the yard up with creatures. [Sidisi, Brood Tyrant](https://scryfall.com/card/ktk/199/sidisi-brood-tyrant) will most likley be where you get started. Unless you start out with something cheaper in hand.

#### Phase Two: Set the Stage
Use your recursion and search abilities to set the board. [Lazav, the Multifarious](https://scryfall.com/card/grn/184/lazav-the-multifarious), [Sidisi, Undead Vizier](https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/120/sidisi-undead-vizier), [Genesis](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/166/genesis).

#### Phase Three: Going Tall
By now your yard should be full of creatures. Get out goyf and start the beat down. Use your suite of options to overcome obstacles. Do you need trample, [Brawn](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/160/brawn)? Do you need flying, [Wonder](https://scryfall.com/card/cm2/56/wonder)?
