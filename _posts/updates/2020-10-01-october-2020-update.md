Losing a posting cadence.

#### Random Ramblings
I had this big realization the other day. I was sitting there looking at magic cards frustrated as usuall at the prices and all the cards I wanted to buy. I was eying a couple other scale models I wanted to pick up. Steam was having a sale and of course several games I had been looking at were like 10 dollars to pick up.

Later that day I got thinking about it and realized I have a whole commander deck I built two months ago that I haven’t even shuffled up and played. I have two model kits I have bought in the last couple months I haven’t started. I have games on my steam account I have never installed since I bought them.

I have less time than I have purchasing power. So I’ve stopped worrying so much about the things I want and am trying to enjoy the things I have.

#### Books
I finished up the third Foundation book. The post for that should be up soon if not already.

#### Video Games
I have been playing Rimworld all month. I started collecting some [tips and tricks in a post](https://tactictalisman.github.io/2020/08/14/rimworld-tips.html). I hope to have a time lapse put together for my current game. The zoom needs to be adjusted though since it's a full map render. I think for this next rimworld year I will do a close up of the base as it's a tundra map and that's where everything happens.

#### Scale Modeling
Last week I started building again and have been going strong since. Hopefully I will get a few pictures posted of the Tiger 1. It has been coming together quite nicely
